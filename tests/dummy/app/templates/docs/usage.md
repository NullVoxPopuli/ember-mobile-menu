# Usage
## Requirements
This addon currently requires `ember-cli-sass` to be used in the main application. Support for pre-compiled CSS will be added at a later time.

## Installation
From your application directory run: 

```sh
ember install ember-mobile-menu
```

The addon will automatically add the necessary SCSS import to your `app.scss`.
